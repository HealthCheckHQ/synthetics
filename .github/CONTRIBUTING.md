## Pull Request Checklist

* Branch from the main branch and, if needed, rebase to the current main branch before submitting your pull request. If it doesn't merge cleanly with main you may be asked to rebase your changes.

* Commits should be as small as possible, while ensuring that each commit is correct independently (i.e., each commit should compile and pass tests).

* If your patch is not getting reviewed or you need a specific person to review it, you can @-reply a reviewer asking for a review in the pull request or a comment.

* Add tests relevant to the fixed bug or new feature.

## Dependency management

The Synethtics project uses [NPM Node modules](https://docs.npmjs.com/about-packages-and-modules) to manage dependencies on external packages.

To add or update a new dependency, use the `npm i` command:

```bash
# Pick the latest tagged release.
npm i pkg@latest

# Pick a specific version.
npm i pkg@vX.Y.Z
```
